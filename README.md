## Project Description ✍️

The stand pickup service will be a business-to-consumer operation, providing transportation services on a rental basis. This system will involve unlocking and locking bicycles, motorcycles, and other vehicles. Customers can make online payments to access vehicles from designated stations. Once the payment is processed, the corresponding vehicle will unlock based on the payment amount. This service operates on an hourly basis, charging customers for each hour of use.

## Objective 📄

- Anyone can pick up a bike or other vehicles from vehicle stations at a reasonable price.
- An easy payment system and an easy way to pick up your vehicles.
- With this service available in every city, you won't need to carry your vehicle everywhere.
- Rent bikes or other vehicles at a lower price.

## Here are three channels- 
- Vehicles Stations 
- Lock and Unlock Vehicles
- Online and offline Money payments system
- Putting a price on time
